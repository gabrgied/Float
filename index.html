    Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
    Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
    Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
    I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
    Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
    Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
    Mama, just killed a man
    Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
    Mama, life had just begun
    But now I've gone and thrown it all away
    Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
    If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
    Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters </p>

    Too late, my time has come
    Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
    Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
    Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
    Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
    I don't wanna die
    I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all </p>

  <p>I see a little silhouetto of a man
    Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
    Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
    (Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
    But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
    He's just a poor boy from a poor family
    Spare him his life from this monstrosity
    Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
    Bismillah! No, we will not let you go </p>

      <p>  (Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
    (Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
    (Let me go) Will not let you go
    (Let me go) Will not let you go
    (Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
    No, no, no, no, no, no, no
    (Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go </p>

    Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
    So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
    So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
    Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
    Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
    Nothing really matters, anyone can see
    Nothing really matters
    Nothing really matters to me
    Any way the wind blows </p>
